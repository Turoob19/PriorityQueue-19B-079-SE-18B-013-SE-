## Priority Queue:
A priority queue is a special type of queue in which each element is associated with a priority and is served according to its priority. 
If elements with the same priority occur, they are served according to their order in the queue.

## Functions Used:
Here are the following functions that we used in this program:\
A)	Implemented a class Heapq.
Which gives the size and inf to the array.\
B)	Made a fucntions root.\
It returns the first element of the heap\
C)	Made a function parent.\
Which return the index of the parent node.\
D)	Get left child.\
Which gets us the left child of an element\
E)	Get right child.\
Which gives us the right child of an element\
F)	Made a function increase key.\
comparing the values of the index and swaping if the condition is true\
G)	Made a function decrease key.\
checking if the input key is greater than undex value in the priority queue\
H)	Made a function Max heapify.\
comparing the right node index with heap size and heap index\
comparing the left node index with heap size and heap index\
swaping if the given condition satisfy

I)	made a function extract max.\
J)	made a function enqueuer\
which enters the value in o(1).

K)	Made a function get maximum.\
Which gives us the maximum value.

L)	Made built max heap.

M)	Made Get_minimum.\
Get the minimum value of the priority queueu\
N)	 Def Print(self):\
Prints the values.

## Working:
Download the code and run it in your environment.\
Make sure to use different values to get a better understanding of the working of the code.
